Title:
Model-Measurements intercomparison of biogenic SOA in West Africa

Introduction:
In this paper we present measurements of aerosol particles made over forest in West Africa.
Chemical composition and mass concentrations were measured using AMS (Allen et al 2004).
Smith et al 2007 made measurements in this region, and while they were great, we need more in order to answer the questions they were unable to address (Simth et al 2007).

Simulations:
We present here simultations of aerosol particle formation, using the chamber model.

Results:
We found out some stuff that previously was unknown.
The simulations did a good job of reproducing the measurements.

Conclusions:
We gained valuable insight into the formation processes of SOA from biogenic gases.
Some questions remain unasnswered, so give us more money.
