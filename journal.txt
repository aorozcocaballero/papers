Title:
Measurements of secondary organic aerosol

Introduction:
In this paper we present measurements of aerosol particles made over forest in West Africa.
Chemical composition and mass concentrations were measured using AMS (Allen et al 2004).
Smith et al 2007 made measurements in this region, and while they were great, we need more in order to answer the questions they were unable to address (Simth et al 2007).
